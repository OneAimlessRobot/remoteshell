TODO:
it isnt ready yet.
this thing needs the self pipe trick so it can stop select calls and close descriptors.

Make a thread that owns a socket.
pair that socket up with a file descriptor own by that same thread.
make a pipe between that (on the read end) 
and a known ctrl descriptor (on the write end)
then,
before closing that thread,
write at least 1 byte to that pipe.
and [then] close the socket.

do this for every single thread.
